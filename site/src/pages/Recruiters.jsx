As an applicant, it's frustrating to receive the same vague response hundreds of times, with no idea what went wrong. That's why I created this form!

I'd genuinely appreciate your honest feedback. Whether I passed your resume screen or interviewâ€”or didn'tâ€”your thoughts are greatly appreciated.

If you had a positive impression, feel free to share that too!`;

      <p>
        Weâ€™ve got two AWS Lambda functions â€” one handles feedback form submissions and stores them in S3, the other sends recruiter questions to OpenAIâ€™s API using a vectorized <code className="bg-gray-200 px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-xs">data.jsonl</code> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both are triggered through API Gateway. Everythingâ€™s wired up using Terraform â€” from IAM roles to policies to Lambda permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All infra lives in AWS Free Tier â€” and yes, itâ€™s fully reproducible via code on GitHub.
